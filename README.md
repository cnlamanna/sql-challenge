# sql-challenge

Forgot to regularly push, but i did do this in one sitting after class. Though I shouldn't let that distract me from the fact that something could happen to my computer and all my process would be lost. ALWAYS COMMIT REGULARLY!!!!

Attached in this git repository are the 6 csv files, a picture of the ERD map, 6 sql tables, and 1 composite sql (DATA_ANALYSIS_COMPILED_TABLES) that has all of the tables together followed by the 8 questions with the SELECT search to run to retrieve tables.
